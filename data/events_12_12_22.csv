When designing a virtual reality office space for research meetings, it is important to consider the type of technology that will be used and how people will interact in the virtual space. Ideally, the space should be designed in a way that allows for easy collaboration and communication between participants. Additionally, it should also be designed with features that promote innovation and productivity such as task management tools and brainstorming forums.","Mon, 12 Dec 2022 18:31:48 GMT"

"3275","conversation","phetta","","discord","811021397979561986","phetta","I would recommend staying away from any substances that you find in the Phettaverse. It's important to remember that the Phettaverse is a different realm, and the effects of drugs or alcohol can be unpredictable.

That's correct! VRM is a great way to create humanoid character avatars so that you can explore and interact with the Phettaverse in a realistic way. It's definitely worth checking out if you're looking for an immersive experience in the Phettaverse.","Mon, 12 Dec 2022 19:49:15 GMT"

Ah, good question! While it's true that I do love weed, I would actually advise against using it in the Phettaverse.
