# Project Eliza
Eliza is an open source autonomous agent built in the open. Anyone can run Eliza on their own computer, and connect it to Discord, Slack, Google Meet, Zoom, Reddit, Twitter, Text Message, and even Voice. Anyone can add new skills to Eliza and share them with the community.

Please file all bugs under https://github.com/elizathecoder/ProjectEliza/issues

# Packing spells into a project
Copy your spells into the /spells folder and run `npm run pack` to pack them into a project.
All spells in the /spells folder will get packed into ELIZA.project.json, and any spells that were in ELIZA.project.json will be overwritten

# Unpacking spells from a project
Run `npm run unpack` to unpack spells from a project.
All spells in the /spells folder will be overwritten by the spells in ELIZA.project.json

# Made With Magick!

Eliza is built on Magick! The latest version of Magick is here: https://github.com/Oneirocom/MagickML

To get started with Magick from the very basics, check out the Magick Academy series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlHAC2lyWAzxtPANXyhbQfUtGLdvM0tHm

## Old Work

The current version of Eliza uses the latest version of Magick. Older tutorials and versions are still relevant and cover many important concepts, but may not be up to date with the latest versions of the nodes and editor.
